# MySpotifyContents
Basic Android App using MVP. It connects to Spotify API then shows top ten artists and their top ten songs.

Initially has a mocked parameter to filter the top ten artists, currently is using GB (Great Britain) for this. 

A future feature will add this as parameter and will allow the user to select from a list the country to filter the artists.
